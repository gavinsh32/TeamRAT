# Project RAT
Working repository for 2025 Capstone Senior Design Project: R.A.T. (Reconstruction & Analysis of Tendons)

## Overview
This repository contains various tools for deploying a fine-tuned SAM model, including dataset validation, augmentation, and training.

## Background
Researchers are interested in how rats move their tails. Tendons,
which connect muscle to bone, are comprised of numerous, tiny
fibers called fascicles. These are too difficult for existing
methods to detect automatically and are usually done by hand,
requiring substantial manual labor and hindering progress.â€‹
